# hostingStaticSitesDemo
Demo application for hosting a static website on Heroku using some Java and Spring Boot. 
Spring Boot is used to bootstrap a Tomcat Webserver delivering the static website.
This demo at the moment just shows of some basic config. It can most likely improved further features
like some dynamic pages implemented using Spring MVC and generation of the static pages from
templates in the gradle build.
